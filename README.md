# PBR Surface Inputs in ShaderGraph (URP)

In this tutorial repository and [accompanying video](https://youtu.be/ObpmdNTgVps) you will learn how to recreate all the standard surface inputs (PBR) on the URP/Lit Shader in Unity ShaderGraph! 

In this video and repository you'll learn how to add the following PBR surface inputs to your own shader so you can keep the PBR look and feel while adding in any special shader effects:

* Albedo
* Specular (including environment reflections)
* Normal Map
* Height Map
* Ambient Occlusion (AO)
* Emission

You'll also learn how to use the high quality parallax occlusion mapping node, which improves upon the standard "Parallax Mapping" that the URP/Lit Shader uses by default.
Parallax Occlusion Mapping is a great way to add depth to your flat planes without adding any geometry!
How this works and how to use the node is covered in the second YouTube tutorial below.

## Requirements
* This was implemented with Universal Render Pipeline 17, but should also work for the Built-in Render Pipeline. HDRP likely is different.
* I'm using Unity 6, but this functionality should be working on pretty much any modern version of Unity.

* Parallax Occlusion Mapping node will not be available on older versions of URP (likely 2021 and below).
