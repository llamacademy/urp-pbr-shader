# PBR Surface Inputs in ShaderGraph (URP)

In this tutorial repository and [accompanying video](https://youtu.be/ObpmdNTgVps) you will learn how to recreate all the standard surface inputs (PBR) on the URP/Lit Shader in Unity ShaderGraph! 

In this video and repository you'll learn how to add the following PBR surface inputs to your own shader so you can keep the PBR look and feel while adding in any special shader effects:

* Albedo
* Specular (including environment reflections)
* Normal Map
* Height Map
* Ambient Occlusion (AO)
* Emission

## Requirements
* This was implemented with Universal Render Pipeline 17, but should also work for the Built-in Render Pipeline. HDRP likely is different.
* I'm using Unity 6, but this functionality should be working on pretty much any modern version of Unity.
